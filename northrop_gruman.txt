Hello,

I am writing to express my interest in the Front End Developer Integrated Analytics position at Northrop Grumman. With over five years of experience in developing web based applications, coupled with proficiency in .NET backend development, Angular and plotly.js and database management, I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to your team and drive impactful results. 

In one of my previous roles at Equitable, I took lead on several .NET development Variable life insurance projects from inception to deployment, demonstrating a general understanding of both backend and frontend technologies. My expertise in designing, implementing, and optimizing Object oriented .NET applications allowed me to deliver robust and scalable solutions that met and exceeded client expectation and made maintaining and extending them manageable.

Furthermore, my proficiency in Angular has enabled me to develop dynamic and responsive user interfaces, enhancing the overall user experience of web applications. I have a solid understanding of frontend frameworks and libraries, which I leverage to create visually appealing and intuitive interfaces that resonate with end-users. Please see my current project (https://datanets.azurewebsites.net) which I'm currently working on. It's a financial analysis app, that lets you analyze stock prices, using a programming language that I created. It also has plenty of plots on the landing page that I implemented using plotly.js. 

Additionally, my experience in database application development has equipped me with the skills to design and manage complex databases, ensuring data integrity, security, and performance. I am well-versed in SQL and have a proven track record of optimizing database queries and improving system efficiency. I can use a ORM approach via Entity framework, or I can do it directly with the SQL database. 

What excites me about the opportunity at Northrop Grumman is the chance to work on creating interesting data visualizations, something in which i enjoy. I am eager to collaborate with talented professionals and contribute my expertise to deliver high-quality software solutions that drive business growth and success. I'm also looking forward to learning and being challenged. 

Thank you for considering my application. I am enthusiastic about the possibility of joining your team and am available for an interview at your earliest convenience. Please find my resume attached for your review.

Warm regards,
Mark
