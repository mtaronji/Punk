PUNK Design specs

Punk will be used from the front end UI to achieve various tasks. 

We are using a recursive approach visa vi trees. 

For example - say we had a statement of the form 7 = 5 + 3 

Our algorithm will create a tree as follows:

					Equals
				  /        \
				 7         Add
				          /   \
						5       3

The parser will return the Equals node. Evaulating the equals node will give you the result in a number node. 

This language also leans on the of the .NET compiler as well, especially for parsing data using linq.
